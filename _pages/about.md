Hi! I'm Davide and this is my personal webpage.

I'm a theoretical physicist and I'm currently carrying out my research in Paris, after completing my undergraduate studies in Sapienza University (Rome, Italy) and getting a PhD in Statistical Physics in SISSA (Trieste, Italy). 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My <strong>research interests</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stochastics dynamics of soft and active matter systems</li>
<li>Non-Markovian stochastic processes and fluctuation-induced forces</li>
<li>Nonequilibrium statistical field theory</li>
<li>Random matrix theory and disordered systems</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

(This personal webpage is still very much in progress, and I don't know how long it's going to take me to set it up and running...)
